# Overview

**BotLi** is a bot for Lichess. Strongly inspired by [ShailChoksi/lichess-bot](https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot). It extends its features with a matchmaking mode where the bot automatically challenges other bots with similar ratings.

# How to install

- **NOTE: Only Python 3.10 or later is supported!**
- Download the repo into BotLi directory: `git clone https://github.com/Torom/BotLi.git`
- Navigate to the directory in cmd/Terminal: `cd BotLi`
- Copy `config.yml.default` to `config.yml`

Install all requirements:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Customize the `config.yml` according to your needs.

## Lichess OAuth
- Create an account for your bot on [Lichess.org](https://lichess.org/signup).
- **NOTE: If you have previously played games on an existing account, you will not be able to use it as a bot account.**
- Once your account has been created and you are logged in, [create a personal OAuth2 token with the "Play games with the bot API" ('bot:play') scope](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token/create?scopes[]=bot:play&description=BotLi) selected and a description added.
- A `token` will be displayed. Store this in the `config.yml` file as the `token` field.
- **NOTE: You won't see this token again on Lichess, so do save it.**

## Setup Engine
Within the file `config.yml`:
- Enter the directory containing the engine executable in the `engine: dir` field.
- Enter the executable name in the `engine: name` field.
- You need to adjust the settings in `engine: uci_options` depending on your system.

## Setup opening book
To use an opening book you have to enter a name of your choice and the path to the book at the end of the config in the `books` section.

In the upper `eninge: opening_books: books` section you only have to enter the name you just chose. In addition, different books can be used for white, black and chess960. If no specific book is defined, the `standard` books are used.

For example, the `books` section could look like this:
```yaml
books:
  Goi: "./engines/Goi.bin"
  Perfect: "/home/Books/Perfect2021.bin"
  Cerebellum: "Cerebellum.bin"
```
A corresponding `engine: opening_books:` section could look like this:
```yaml
  opening_books:
    enabled: true
    books:
      white:
        - "Perfect"
        - "Goi"
#     black:
#       - "BlackBook"
      standard:
        - "Cerebellum" 
#     chess960:
#       - "Chess960Book"
    selection: "weighted_random"
```

# How to control

## Interacitve mode

In this mode the bot is controlled by commands entered into the console.

### Start

To start the bot, type:

```bash
python user_interface.py
```
The bot automatically accepts challenges. Which challenges are accepted is defined in the config in the section `challenge`.

To see all commands, type:
```
help
```

### Matchmaking

To challenge other players with similar ratings, type:
```
matchmaking
```

Change the settings in `matchmaking` in the config to change how this bot challenges other players. The bot will pause matchmaking for incoming challenges. To exit the matchmaking mode type:
```
stop
```

To exit the bot completely, type:
```
quit
```

The bot will always wait until the current game is finished.

## Non interactive mode

In this mode, the bot is controlled by flags that are set at the start. This is useful when the bot is running as a service or on Heroku.

### Start

To start the bot in the non interactive mode, type:

```bash
python user_interface.py --non_interactive
```
The bot automatically accepts challenges. Which challenges are accepted is defined in the config in the section `challenge`.

### Matchmaking

To let the bot challenge other bots in non interactive mode, start it like this:

```bash
python user_interface.py --non_interactive --matchmaking
```

**CAUTION**: Lichess will rate limit you if you let matchmaking run for too long.

## Upgrade to Bot account

When the bot is running in interactive mode it will ask for an account upgrade if necessary.

In non interactive mode the `--upgrade` flag must be set at start.


```bash
python user_interface.py --non_interactive --upgrade
```

The account **cannot have played any game** before becoming a Bot account. The upgrade is **irreversible**. The account will only be able to play as a Bot.

# How to deploy to Heroku

**For Heroku, any config change must be made in `config.yml.default`. Do NOT rename it to `config.yml`!**

- [Fork](https://github.com/Torom/BotLi/fork) this repository.
- Create a [new heroku app](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app).
- Go to [Account Settings](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account) on Heroku, scoll down to `API Key` and copy it.
- In your fork go to `Settings` -> `Secrets` and create a `New repository secret`. Name is `HEROKU_API_KEY` and value is the api key from Heroku.
- Create another `New repository secret`. Name is `HEROKU_EMAIL` and value is the email adress you use for Heroku.
- Go to `Settings` tab on Heroku and create a variable, set `LICHESS_BOT_TOKEN` as key and your Lichess token as value.
- Go to the `Actions` tab on your fork and enable them.
- Insert your app name into the [.github/workflows/main.yml](/.github/workflows/main.yml) of your fork and commit it.

Now the docker container gets deployed. This may take a moment. After the successful deployment, the worker needs to be activated in the `Resources` tab on Heroku.

**Your bot is now online and ready to play.**

## Customize your bot

By default, the Dockerfile loads the latest Stockfish version from [abrok](https://abrok.eu/stockfish/).

If you want another engine or additional files like opening books to be downloaded you have to add this in the Dockerfile. Remember to modify your `config.yml.default` accordingly.

To start the matchmaking mode just add the `--matchmaking` flag to the `CMD` line in the Dockerfile.
